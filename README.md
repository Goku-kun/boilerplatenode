## General info

Instead of having to create .js files and having to import same utilities time and again, let `boilerplatenode` handle this work for you. Just run it as a regular command after linking it and pass the appropriate flags for importing these system modules. `boilerplatenode` automates this work. You can take this further and even write shell scripts calling this command and it would generate as many files as you want.

It doesn't have any dependencies and hence it'll work with a system that has node installed without requiring anything else.

## Inspiration

The sole inspiration for creating this package is to automate the daily task of creating files using `touch` and then importing the same boiler plate code everyday before starting to write some actual implementation of the new program.
